"Curiosity killed a cat, but infinite knowledge brought it back."

## THE BACKSTORY
In the 90s, Tamagotchi was a huge trend. Everybody was obsessed with it. Children would stay glued to their pets for hours in order to keep them alive.
So we thought, what if you didn't need to keep your pet alive? What if instead, you had to kill it as many times as possible?
And that's how Bob was born.

Bob is an ancient and powerful creature. However, back in his days, Bob has been slayed by an even more powerful Hero. And ever since, Bob has wanted revenge. He needs to live through as many lives as possible, and to study as much as possible, in order to get an infinite knowledge and finally get his revenge on the Hero.

Join Bob in his quest for revenge, and help him through the many lives that he has to go through!
